  AI Customer Service Agent
</h1>

<p align="center">
  This academic project is an AI-powered customer service agent that takes customer orders for a restaurant. This provides an alternate method for consumers to
  place their orders from the standard navigation and selection on a menu on a website to a more condensed environment with minimal navigation.
  The restaurant used is Firehouse Subs.
